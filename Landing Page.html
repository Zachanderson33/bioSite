    <h1>All About Rosa</h1>
    <h2> Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
	I was inspired to make this website about my wife Rosa. She is a first generation American. Her parents immigrated here from Guadalajara, Mexico all the way up north to Seattle, Washington. Her hobbies include but are not limited to hiking, biking, snowboarding, snowshoeing, kayaking, river floating, boating, wakeboarding, paddleboarding, camping, and running. She loves the outdoors and would spend more time outside than inside if it was up to her. She is full of energy all the time and always wants to be doing something new. She is a firecracker in a 5’1” frame. She has such a passion for life it is infectious. She has been active-duty military for almost 10 years and is about 1 year from changing career paths to something on the civilian side. Her dream job would be a firefighter, she did a firefighting course before joining the Air Force and absolutely loved it. Her favorite kind of animal is a Bengal cat. We own one and her name is Flynn Rider. She is the most hyper cat I have ever met in my life and that’s saying a lot because I have met some crazy cats. But Flynn is Rosa’s favorite indoor past time, Flynn will chase anything for hours and is always ready to play. Flynn has her own cat wheel (like a hamster wheel but for cats) and if she doesn’t get enough attention, she can be found running at full speed at around 2 in the morning. Rosa’s dream vacation is southeast Asia mostly for the food they have to offer there but also for the beautiful beaches. If she could have a superpower, it would be to be able to change shape and her favorite color is blue so basically, she wants to be Mr. Fantastic. And I let her add one question of her own and it was what is your favorite kind of wine and her answer to that was Cabernet Sauvignon. What a great interviewee she was!
